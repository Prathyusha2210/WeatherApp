/**
 *  STEPS:
 *
 *  1. Create a class to GET weather data, attach the CORS using .ajaxPrefilter to the request and GET the woid
 *  2. Use the response from the step above and GET the weather for that location
 *  3. Deconstruct the data received and shape it to what the UI expects it to look like before sending to the UI
 *  4. Add error/loading states and cover edge use cases
 *  5. Divide classes per function to have a more clean code approach and separation on concerns
